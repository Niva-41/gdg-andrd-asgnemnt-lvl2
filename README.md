SOLUTION FOR THE ASSIGNMENT:-

Task 1 : Implement a To-do App on the Command Line using OOPS Concepts (5 points - Beginner Level)
Your objective is to construct a straightforward Command Line Interface (CLI)
program to manage a to-do list. The primary focus is on applying foundational
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, like classes and objects, while
the implementation can be generalized to any programming language of your
choice.
Requirements:
Use classes and objects to implement the solution.
Menu Interface: Develop a basic menu-driven interface that empowers users to
perform these actions:
● Add a new task.
● Mark a task as completed.
● Display the list of tasks.
You're not bound to strictly follow the requirements provided. Feel free to adjust
the project as you see fit, while still incorporating the fundamental principles of
OOP. Your implementation can vary, allowing you to explore creative possibilities
within the realm of OOP concepts.
The more optimal and additional features/functionality you include on your own
will evaluate a higher score for you.
